<H2> Ticket Classifier & Entity Extractor  </H2>

 Overview  
Customer support teams often receive thousands of tickets daily.  
Manually classifying them by **issue type**, **urgency level**, and extracting **important entities** (like product names, complaint keywords, and dates) takes a lot of time.

- ✅ Predict the **Issue Type** of a support ticket  
- ✅ Predict the **Urgency Level** of the issue  
- ✅ Extract **Product Names, Complaint Keywords, and Dates**  
- ✅ Provide an **interactive Gradio interface** for real-time testing
